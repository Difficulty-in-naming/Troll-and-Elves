# Version History:

## 2025.1: Unity 6 Support
Improvements:
- [Imprv-2025-1] Unity 6 is now fully and officially supported.

## 2024.1.1: Delayed Despawns
- Improvement: Adjusted the spawn behaviour in the demos a little bit.
- Feature: A delayed despawn method for pools has been added. Calling the method starts a coroutine that waits x seconds and then performs the despawning. Useful when despawning a large number of game objects to delay the despawn and reduce garbage collecting.
